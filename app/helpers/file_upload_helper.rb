  # this helper is solely used in the file_upload partial
  # to guess what path to use to destroy any image
  # depending on the form class
  # TODO : this system is ok for now but it's too many conditions
  # we should group those methods into a shared controller rather than duplicating it. very useless.
  # PROBLEM : the controllers don't have the exact same name. i suppose we should first refactor the model and create an `image` model which would simplify everything.
