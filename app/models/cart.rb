  # When the admin changes the properties of a product,
  # the product in the cart has to change as well. Therefore
  # a "has_many" would be the right association â€“ if it was not
  # for one property that has to be kept in the association
  # between Cart and Product:
  # quantity_in_cart. So quantity_in_cart is kept within
  # CartProduct (the proxy embedded in Cart), while the
  # CartProduct itsself "belongs_to" the Product
  # (not embedded/"frozen", therefore remaining independent).
